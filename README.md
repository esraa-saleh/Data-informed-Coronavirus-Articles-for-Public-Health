# Data-informed-Coronavirus-Articles-for-Public-Health
A compilation of data-informed articles on the novel coronavirus, focusing on impacts/strategies for public health, with careful consideration to source credibility. Although scientific journal articles are cool and I'll add some, I would like to focus efforts on good quality material that is accessible and readable for those who are not subject matter experts. I encourage contributions that contain intuitive explanations and interactive demonstrations of relevant concepts (e.g. social distancing).

### Instructions for Contributing
  To contribute to this compilation of resources, please submit a pull request. 
  You request should contain four things:
  1) The title of the article you're sharing.
  2) The source of the article as well as the credentials/affiliation of the author(s).
  3) A link to the article you'd like to share.
  4) A brief 1-2 sentences description of the subject matter covered in the article.
  
  The table is in HTML. Note that you don't need to code to contribute! (although that would be nice).
  You may simply write up the items above in a pull request in plain text. You could also open an issue and request 
  the addition of an article.
  
  To give feedback on article selection (for example, if you believe an article is unreliable), please submit an issue and specify:
  1) The name(s) of the article(s) adressed
  2) Your feedback on each article adressed
  
  I'll do whatever is within my capacity to ensure that sources and author credentials are explicitly written and accurate.
  If a major issue arises with an article, I'll pull it out temporarily and try to seek the help of experts (i.e. specialized researchers) as well as the open source scientific community.
